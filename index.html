              Thomas Bergersen a Norwegian composer born July 4, 1980 who writes music for his co-founded company, Two Steps From Hell. The company focuses
              primarily on instrumental movie and trailer music. They have made countless soundtracks for movies such as Aquaman, Pirates of the Caribbean,
              Harry Potter, The Avengers, and X-Men to name a few. Thomas has said he draws his inspiration from his emotions, romantic relationships, and
              anything “unique and beautiful” in his surroundings.

Here we are
Riding the sky
Painting the night with sun
You and I, mirrors of light
Twin flames of fire
Lit in another time and place

I knew your name
I knew your face
Your love and grace
Past and present now embrace
Worlds collide in inner space
Unstoppable, the songs we play

Burn that page for me
I cannot erase the time of sleep
I cannot be loved, so set me free
I cannot deliver your love
Or caress your soul so

Turn that page for me
I cannot embrace the touch that you give
I cannot find solace in your words
I cannot deliver you your love
Or caress your soul
</pre
          >
          <pre>
Age to age
I feel the call
Memory of future dreams
You and I, riding the sky
Keeping the fire bright
From another time and place

I know your name
I know your face
Your touch and grace
All of time cannot erase
What our hearts remember stays
Forever on a song we play

Burn that page for me
I cannot erase the time of sleep
I cannot be loved, so set me free
I cannot deliver your love
Or caress your soul so

Turn that page for me
I cannot embrace the touch that you give
I cannot find solace in your words
I cannot deliver you your love
Or caress your soul

          <h2>She Walks in Beauty</h2>
          <pre>
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!

        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <p>
          Both poems focus on a similar theme of love and romance. Star Sky describes two lovers who cannot be with each other, while She Walks in Beauty is
          about the beauty of a women where the narrator could possibly be their lover. The main difference between these poems is Star Sky is a more sorrow
          tone as the lovers are unable to be with each other, while She Walks in Beauty is much more pleasant and heartwarming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On the writing aspect, the ladder uses more rhymes than Star Sky and uses a different rhyming scheme. It also utilizes much more complex writing and
          poetic techniques: especially heavy use of implications, reflecting how the poets are different themselves. The poets were born in completely
          different time periods, influencing the context of the poems to be different in a multitude of ways such: as word choice.
